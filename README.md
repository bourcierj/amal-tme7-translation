## Machine Translation with a Sequence-to-Sequence Network

In this practical work, we try to solve the NLP task of machine translation. It consists of translating sentences from a source language to a target language. 

The dataset used is [Anki's dataset](https://www.manythings.org/anki/), a set of bilingual sentence pairs selected from the [Tatoeba Project](https://tatoeba.org/home). Specifically the model is trained on the French to English sentences.
